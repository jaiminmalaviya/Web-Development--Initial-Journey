I did the front end of this website 1 year ago using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap.

http://www.aculance.com/index.html
For this project, the client give me a template and I did the changes according to the client's requirements. But 
if you want to make the website like this then I also do.

#I make many more projects but I don't know where they are listed, so I send you some of my big project files, 
and if you want to see my other project then ask me without any hesitation.

#I have 2 years of very well experience in CSS, and I did many big and small projects using CSS. I did 4 projects 
in my past job as a front-end web developer. I have a good grip on the flexbox and grid. In addition, I knew the 
bootstrap very well that's a very popular framework today.
So if you want to know more about my CSS knowledge then freely ask.

#Recently I make an e-commerce website that has 8 pages with fully responsive. I send the file of this project so 
check this once.

#I created many projects using bootstrap, or, I would say I have created most of the projects using bootstrap. 
Recently I also learn about tailwind which is more popular in recent years. And if you use any other framework then 
tell me because I learn things very quickly.

#Hi Eyal, due to some family reasons I am too busy these 2-3 days. So if you like, I can send first page of project 
to this saturday. Yeah, I know this is not big work but I am going to be away from work for 2-3 days.
And if you give me this whole project, I definitely complete the project before next saturday (9th may).
